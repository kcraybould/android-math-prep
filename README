I could not find a math quiz app that had the options that my kids' school used in their test prep (all hail standardized tests!)
This app will, when complete, do the following:

1. Quiz on addition, substraction, multiplication and division
2. Allow for quzzes based on number of questions
3. Allow for quizzes based on a set time limit
4. Allow for quizzes based on operation type, for either question number or time limit
5. ALlow for quizzes based on a a number set (multiplication of 9s, for example), for either question number of time limit
